Requirements of eduOS
=====================

1.) Currently, eduOS supports only x86-based architectures.
2.) Following command line tools have to be installed:
    make, gcc, binutil, git, qemu, nams, gdb
3.) The test PC has to use grub as bootloader.

Building eduOS
==============

1.) Copy Makefile.example to Makefile and edit this Makefile to meet your individual convenience.
2.) Copy include/eduos/config.h.example to include/eduos/config.h and edit this config file to 
    meet your individual convenience.
3.) Build kernel with "make"

Start eduOS via qemu
====================
1.) Install qemu to emulate an x86 architecture
2.) make qemu

Boot eduOS via grub
===================
1.) Copy eduos.elf into the /boot directory.
2.) Create a boot entry in the grub menu. This depends on the version of grub, which is used by 
    the installed Linux system. For instance, we added following lines to /boot/grub/grub.cfg:

   ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/40_custom ###
   # This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the
   # menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change
   # the 'exec tail' line above.
   menuentry "Boot eduOS!" {
          multiboot       /boot/eduos.elf
          boot
   }
